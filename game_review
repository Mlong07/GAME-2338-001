## Summary

This game is about a young girl nammed Aloy and is set in a post apocolyptic world. 
This world is overrun with machines in the form of prehistoric dinosaurs.
You play as Aloy, the young hunter, to defeat these machines and uncover your past.
Machines aren't the only enemies in this world however, Aloy also has to face off against bandits and other human enemies.
With stealth being your greatest advantage, the game creators give you multiple ways to take down these enemies
wether it's you using the spear, setting traps, or shooting them with arrows as your ranged weapon. 
The mechanics of the combat itself is fun to work with. You take more of a hit and run
approach with facing enemies, as they are usually bigger and stronger, it's best to avoid their attacks. 
AS the enemies get stronger throughout the game, there is also modification slots
on your weapons to help improve them and make them stronger as you progress through the story.
Looting the defeated enemies gives you resources you need to replensih ammo and craft more traps and resources.
From the beginning of the game, Aloy comes across an area with advanced technology and finds what's called a Focus.
A focus is a small device that Aloy wears behind the ear and it has the ability to scan for weaknesses, location,
level, and what kind of loot they will drop.
As you advance in the game, more enemies will be unlocked for you to take down.
A skill tree allows you to unlock and upgrade moves and skills to help your adventure through this world.

... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts

Describe in as much detail as possible what you did and didn't enjoy about the
game and list out your reasons why. Remember this is a review and thus should
stand up to some criticism when making your reasons why you thought this way
about particular features of the game. This should be at a minimum of 1
paragraph.
