## Summary

This game is about a young girl nammed Aloy and is set in a post apocolyptic world. 
This world is overrun with machines in the form of prehistoric dinosaurs.
You play as Aloy, the young hunter, to defeat these machines and uncover your past.
Machines aren't the only enemies in this world however, Aloy also has to face off against bandits and other human enemies.
With stealth being your greatest advantage, the game creators give you multiple ways to take down these enemies
wether it's you using the spear, setting traps, or shooting them with arrows as your ranged weapon. 
The mechanics of the combat itself is fun to work with. You use your stealth as much as you can, if not a hit and run
approach with facing enemies, as they are usually bigger and stronger. It's best to avoid their attacks.

AS the enemies get stronger throughout the game, there is also modification slots
on your weapons to help improve them and make them stronger as you progress through the story.
Looting the defeated enemies gives you resources you need to replensih ammo and craft more traps and resources.
From the beginning of the game, Aloy comes across an area with advanced technology and finds what's called a Focus.
A focus is a small device that Aloy wears behind the ear and it has the ability to scan for weaknesses, location,
level, and what kind of loot they will drop. As you advance in the game, more enemies will be unlocked for you to take down.
A skill tree allows you to unlock and upgrade moves and skills to help your adventure through this world.

Fighting the machines never gets old and there are a bunch of ways to take them out like with traps, your spear, or overriding
them and using them as a mount. The beginning mission which seconds as the tutorial, eases you into the controller layout and
button mapping for the game. It informs you of the focus, the world Alloy was raised in, and the capabilities of Alloy herself.
The detail put into each enviorment on the map makes it easy to get lost in the story and gameplay itself. The fighting mechanics
are unique in themselves. When fighting the machines, you have your choice of how you want to take it down wether by sealth and a spear,
fighting face to face and timing a perfect dodge so you can counter before the enemy has time to recover, or using 1 of about 10
different traps to stall and/ or weaken your opponent.

## Final Thoughts

I found this game to easily become one of my favorites after the 1st day of play. It has just about everything from free roaming
and exploring the world and taking in the sceneary (in a moment of peace), to forging and gather resouces to craft new or upgraded
weapons. The compelling story and cut scenes keeps you entertained as you play for hours, they help to develop the story and give your hands a rest
from the constant dodging and firing of your arrows. The introduction of newer machines as you progress keeps the fighting entertaining
as you have to fight each enemy differently than others, which makes you develp new strategies and maybe try new weapons you have yet
to use. The experience you get out of the whole game is well worth the price of the game and I look forward to the sequel coming out
next year.
