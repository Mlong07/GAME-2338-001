### Rating
I rate this game a 8.5/10

## Summary

The campaign in this game takes the player through more events of World War II. It is the first in 
the Call of Duty franchise that brings in the "zombies" mode, which is the main reason why this will 
always be one of my favorite video games in the franchise. With the campaign, the online multi-player, 
and zombies gameplay, there was plenty of gaming to be done in this title.

The zombies gameplay ended up being a huge success which they would in turn intergrate it into the 
franchies future games in the black ops series. The developers made it interesting by not just having
the player run around and kill zombies but instead had the player locked up in a building with little 
resources fighting off waves of zombies. With the ability to buy upgraded weapons, choose other 
areas within the building to open, and even a mystery box that could give the best weaons imaginable,
or leave you with nothing useful.

The good thing about first person shooters is that they are all relativley the same button layout
for the controls so picking up on how to play the game isn't too much of a hassle, plus there's a 
tutorial in the beginning of the campaign, but if you choose to jump straight into zombies or 
onlines, can become a hassle when trying to out-run zombies or a bullets from an enemy.

## Final Thoughts

Again, the zombies mode won me over for this game. Trying to stay alive as long as possible causing 
a single game to run well over 4 hours, just to find out if there was a end to the waves, made this
game exhilarating and fun to play. The gameplay itself was seemless, you could run past a gun on the 
wall and purchase it without having to completly stop and look at the weapon, which would get you 
killed in zombies mode. Using a scope from a distance forced you to account for the distance and 
even the wind between the you and the target. The amount of detail that was put into the mechanics
of this game might go unnoticed while playing it but when you actually think of how realistic the 
physics of the game are, it's hard to imagine how much effort and time was put into the making of 
this game.
