### Rating

I got pretty addicted to it so I'm gonna rate it 9/10 

## Summary

This game is about building and developing your own village and army, gathering resources,
and fighting other players villages to take their resources for your own. Starting off the 
usability of the game is easy enough for children to understand and also comes along
with a quick play-through totorial that throws your right in a fight and shows you how to
build your defences and attacking other villages to make sure you get it right.

The fighting takes a big part of this game and does not dissapoint its players. Of course 
players start off small when it comes to their army, not only in numbers but also in stregnth in
relation to the characters. As you level up, you unlock more troops and defences, all with 
different styles and types of attacks and abilities. With the in game animations of the battle
taking place, it's easy to get lost in watching something you built, destroy something
that someone else had put their effor into building.

The catch to the game is that everything takes time, so, in order to produce your resources,
you need to wait before you can actually collect it. This the same for troops, buildings, gold, 
and even attacks after a certain number. This game uses elixir and gold as its currency but also
features a market where you can purchase gems that allow you to exchange them for resources,
or to fast forward the time it takes to finish building or collecting. The only way to purchase
the gems however is with real world currency.

## Final Thoughts

At the end of it all, the game itself is very addicting and easy to be caught up in. What ruined
it for me was the push towards in game buyin, because otherwise, after leveling up enough to
buy some of the stronger, higher level troops and items, and upgrading everything as much as 
you can, you spend days having to wait for a new building or upgrade. The fighting between
the players is still fun either way.
