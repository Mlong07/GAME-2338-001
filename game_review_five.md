### Rating

I give this game a rating of 9/10.

## Summary

This game is about the new kid in town going on a journey to become "cool"
to the other kids in town. The Stick of Truth is the first game written by
the actual creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The game itself
is an RPG with turn based fighting mchanics.

From the jump, the game lets you know, what kind of game you are getting into.
As any game where you can create a character, you get to choose a name for your
character too. The Stick of Truth somehow found a way to let you choose your name
while also giving you your name. After going through the ordeal of my
character, I couldn't help but laugh with the outcome and I think anyone who is
a fan of the franchise will have the same reaction.

The main story and quest themselves give the player plenty to do with a playtime
of about 11 hours, but if that's not long enough, then side quest are always
available to complete to extend that playtime once you complete your main mission.
The animations within the game and fight scenes are something you can hope to see
on the show itself. I think the overall game stays true to it's name and will
definetly satisfy any South Park fan.

## Final Thoughts

The actual gameplay itself isn't causing people to rant on about this game,
but the actual script adn storyline of the game is what's causing me to 
enjoy this game and keep playing to finish it. It is a little time consuming
and when walking through the town completing quest, it does tend to drag
and get a bit boring between cutscenes that make this game what it is.
