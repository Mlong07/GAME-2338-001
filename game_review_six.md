## Summary

This game is about a battle between gods, godesses and other mythological figures. It features many 
different game modes such as conquest, joust, and clash. Players can choose between many characters 
belonging to a variety of clases. It is free to play and availabe on pc and all major consoles. It's
also host multiple tournaments.


## Final Thoughts
I liked the battle functions in this game. It was easy to get the hang of being in battle
without dying right away. Each class has their own sets of weapons and powers but overall
each is pretty even with the others so there isn't a dominat class, just one that you
prefer.
