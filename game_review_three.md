### Rating
I rate this a 10/10

## Summary

This game is about a robot who chooses to fight for Dr. light the scientist that created
him against his former partner Dr. Wiley, the scientist that betrayed him and took control
of most of Dr. Light's robots. It's a side scrolling platform with simple controls and
mechanics that created a different way for how we play games.

Mega Man was the first game to have the player actually choose the path they wanted
to take, which levels they wanted to play and in what order. Until this game, games
were played in a linear order where you had level 1-10 for example and played them
numerically in order to beat the game. Mega Man gave the player an advantage by letting
them decide which boss was easiet for them to beat at the time.

My favorite mechanic in the game is the fact that when Mega Man defeats an opponet, he
then steals their move and can use it as his own. This made the game more enjoyable and
gave a greater incentive to play through the game to gather more powers and defeat the
bosses.

## Final Thoughts

I loved everything about this game. To me, it was the first game that was difficult to
pull away from and put down. The enemies in the stages were differnt from each other,
and each boss had their own ability along with fighting style and the way they use their
abilities. Everything was a challenge in this game from fighting enemies through the level
to get to the bosses, to the bosses themselves.
